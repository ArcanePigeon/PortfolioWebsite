This mod will add 250+ items, blocks, and accessories.

## What To Expect
Doodads is a mod that will add over 250 different items and accessories to minecraft. I will be releasing this mod in sections which could be anywhere from 1 - 20 items at a time. Everything will be very configurable.

All names, items, and uses are not final as many are based on terraria accessories. If you see it here that is no guarantee that it will make it into the mod.

Come talk about the mod and suggest your ideas on the [discord](https://discord.gg/DWBttJkkrn).
