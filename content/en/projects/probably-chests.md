## About Development
Probably Chests is a minecraft mod made for the fabric loader. It is my third Minecraft mod; created in April of 2022. Creating this mod was a new challenge as I got to learn how to use the GeckoLib library to create interesting animations for the mimics. I had many interesting challenges with making the animations play properly as GeckoLib does all rendering client side which meant I could not modify the value of a data tracker from inside the animation which I used to keep track of the mimics current states as it would break completely when modified from the client. I solved this by using the short circuit order of the checks for the current states to make sure the right animation was always playing. Another thing I had to learn was how to do world generation which, because of the way I wanted my chests to spawn in the world, meant I had to create a whole new custom placement modifier. The mod is still in beta and I intend on making it a full release once I finish adding pet mimics and making sure the mod is compatible with every other fabric mod. Once I finish the first full release of the mod I will add compatibility with numismatic overhaul so that when run together the pots and chests will spawn with that modâ€™s currency. I will also be making probably chests integrate with my next mod which I have begun planning that will add 250+ items and accessories mostly inspired by terraria.

## About The Mod
The mod adds many different biome specific pots and chests that spawn all over the world which can contain amazing loot. You can smash the pots to get simple items you need for caving while the rare chests can contain a huge range of items. The chests however have a chance to actually be a mimic when you attempt to open them. Mimics are very fast and strong so open the chests at your own peril. Only naturally spawning chests can be mimics, however if you wish to make your own mimics you can find mimic key fragments inside of the chests which allow you to craft the mimic key. Using a mimic key on a chest will turn it into a mimic chest that will transform when the next player attempts to interact with it. Mimics have a rare chance to drop a mimic core which when combined with a mimic key makes a pet mimic key. Using a pet mimic key on a chest makes you your very own pet mimic which will follow you around and can be used to store items.
