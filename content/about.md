## "Hi! I'm Holly, and I'm a Game Desginer and Gameplay Programmer"

I am also an artist, actor, board game junkie, and traveling enthusiast when I am not working on games. I am a graduate from North Carolina State University where I got a degree in Computer Science. I am currently developing Minecraft mods and a Co-Op puzzle game in Unity. Working on games has been my passion since I was a kid when I was learning to make Flash games with ActionScript and C++ games with OpenFrameworks. I love learning new platforms and am a quick learner. I specialize in Game Design but enjoy tackling any problem placed in front of me.

Some of my favorite games are:

- Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door
- Luigis Mansion
- Minecraft
- Terraria
- Baba Is You
- Blackout Club
- Project Winter
- It Takes Two
