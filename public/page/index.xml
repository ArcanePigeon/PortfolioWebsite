      <description>&amp;ldquo;Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Holly, and I&amp;rsquo;m a Game Desginer and Gameplay Programmer&amp;rdquo; I am also an artist, actor, board game junkie, and traveling enthusiast when I am not working on games. I am a graduate from North Carolina State University where I got a degree in Computer Science. I am currently developing Minecraft mods and a Co-Op puzzle game in Unity. Working on games has been my passion since I was a kid when I was learning to make Flash games with ActionScript and C++ games with OpenFrameworks.</description>
