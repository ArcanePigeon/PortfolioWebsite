      <description>Pineapple defense is a simple tower defense game where you must defend you master pineapple from waves of pizza monsters.
About Development Pineapple Defense was made in Unity as a part of a challenge to make a game that had the theme of pineapples. The game is based on the old flash game Desktop Tower Defense but changes things up with new enemy types, crazier towers, and a new strategy of placing your master pineapple and protecting it as waves come from all directions.</description>
